158,2621,Oh! No mortal could support the horror
159,2606,I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my

202,2609,"Summer passed away in these occupations, and"
203,2560,"The month of May had already commenced,"
204,2869,We passed a fortnight in these perambulations:

252,2967,"“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine"

260,3095,We passed a few sad hours until
261,2887,The appearance of Justine was calm. She

263,2525,Justine was called on for her defence.

272,3034,I cannot pretend to describe what I

274,2995,"“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided"
275,3327,This was a dire blow to poor
276,3130,Soon after we heard that the poor
277,2571,We entered the gloomy prison chamber and
278,2999,"“Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you"
279,2996,“And do you also believe that I

298,3384,About this time we retired to our
